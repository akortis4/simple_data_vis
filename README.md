# simple_data_vis

# Quick overview
This project is a meant to be a simple data summary and
data visualization tool. The purpose of this program is 
to take user input, a data file, and export an excel with
simple data summary and charts. It will also export all
charts as there own png file to be used in other
applications.

# User Input
This will be a json file with specific user inputs.
1. file_name --> (string) file directory and name
2. delimiter --> (string) the delimiter used in the file
3. dependent_variable --> (string) the column name of the dependent varible, y-axis on charts 
4. as_object --> (list) list of strings of variables that may be being read as numeric but need to be treated as objects
5. export_folder --> (string) file path to be used for saving the exported data
6. chart_png_export --> (bool) default to False, will tell the program to export charts to png objects

# Data set
I will be using the train.csv data set from Kaggle.com's housing prediciton training competition.
It is located here:
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data
In theory this initial version should work with in csv data set.

# Running the program
This program is run from the terminal or command line as and assumes you have python set correctly in system path
in the system's environment variables. This application should be downloaded and stored all in one directiry.
1. Be sure the terminal or command line window is in the same directory as SimpleDataVis.py's location. Also, all
sub-folders should be in that same directory otherwise it will cause import errors for this example.

2. Run the following from the command line: python SimpleDataVis.py ./user_input/user_input.json

# Ouput
1. Excel
The first output will be a an excel that notates the dependent variable chosen, and a drop down for
all numeric (int, float) independent variables to selected. Once an indpendent variable several
metrics will be filled in:
Min
25%
Mean
Median
75%
Max
Variance
Standard Deviation
And a scatter plot chart will be filled plotting the independent variable to the dependent variable

2. Scatter plot charts as png's
These will be a full set of scatter charts saved as png to used in other applications, if
chart_png_export = True

# Python Version
3.11

# External Module Dependency
These modules will need to be install before running the program
1. pandas
2. matplotlib
3. openpyxl
4. json --> most likely installed by default

# Module Descriptions
1. SimpleDataVis --> main module used to call and create all other classes
2. UserInputHandler --> module to store user input from json input file
3. ReadDataHandler --> module used to handle loading of data and creating it as a dataframe
4. StatHandler --> create stats for variables
5. CreateExcelHandler --> module used to create and format excel, store defualt excel formatting, and writing data to excel
6. CreatePlotPngHandler --> module used to create scatter plot pngs

# Future Expansions
1. Handle other file types, .txt, .xml, .json, etc.
2. Read data from SQL database
3. Handle data from API or webscraping
4. Implent UI into the program
5. Implent on server with UI from Browser screen
6. Automate process on server with inputs sent directly to program
